"What is Amazon CodeWhisperere","CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion that generates real-time, single-line or full-function code suggestions in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to help you quickly build software. With CodeWhisperer, you can write a comment in natural language that outlines a specific task in English, such as “Upload a file with server-side encryption.” Based on this information, CodeWhisperer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the IDE that can accomplish the task. You can quickly and easily accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. You should always review a code suggestion before accepting them, and you may need to edit it to ensure it does exactly what you intended.For more information, see the User Guides for JetBrains, Visual Studio Code, AWS Cloud9, AWS Lambda console, JupyterLab and Amazon SageMaker Studio."
"Why should I use CodeWhisperere?","CodeWhisperer helps accelerate software development by providing code suggestions that reduce total development effort and allow more time for ideation, complex problem solving, and writing differentiated code. In addition to general purpose code suggestions, CodeWhisperer has additional training to provide code suggestions for using AWS APIs. CodeWhisperer can also help you improve application security by helping detect and remediate security vulnerabilities."
"How does CodeWhisperer work?","As you are writing code, CodeWhisperer analyzes the English language comments and surrounding code to infer what code is needed to complete the task at hand. CodeWhisperer suggests one or more code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating you as you code. The code suggestions provided by CodeWhisperer are based on a large language models (LLMs) trained on billions of lines of code, including Amazon and open-source code. You can quickly and more easily accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. Always review a code suggestion before accepting it, and you may need to edit it to ensure that it does exactly what you intended."
"What data does CodeWhisperer collect to provide code suggestion?","Amazon CodeWhisperer uses your content, such as code snippets, comments, cursor location, and contents from files open in the IDE, as inputs to provide code suggestions."
"How is my content protected when transmitted?","Your content is transmitted using the TLS protocol to ensure secure communication between your IDE and the CodeWhisperer service. The content is encrypted in transit to prevent eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks. For CodeWhisperer Individual users, we may retain content for the purpose of service improvement, based on a user's settings. We store this content in a secured manner with encryption at rest and strict access controls."
"Which programming languages and IDEs does CodeWhisperer support?","Available as part of the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio (VS) Code and JetBrains, CodeWhisperer currently supports Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL and Scala. In addition to VS Code and the JetBrains family of IDEs—including IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, CLion, PhpStorm, RubyMine, Rider, WebStorm, and DataGrip—CodeWhisperer is also available for AWS Cloud9, AWS Lambda console, JupyterLab and Amazon SageMaker Studio."
"How can I get started with CodeWhisperer?","To get started in VS Code or the JetBrains IDEs, watch these brief videos, https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/resources/#Getting_started. You can also follow the instructions in the documentation here, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-indv-devs.html. CodeWhisperer is available by default on AWS Cloud9 and AWS Lambda console. For more information, follow these steps to get started with CodeWhisperer in the AWS Lambda console , and follow these steps to get started with CodeWhisperer in AWS Cloud9 .Follow these instructions to get started with JupyterLab, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/jupyterlab-setup.html, and Amazon SageMaker Studio, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/sagemaker-setup.html."
"After activating the service,where will I see suggestions from CodeWhisperer?","Once CodeWhisperer is enabled, you will receive code suggestions in your code editor as you type. To manually trigger CodeWhisperer, use Option+C (MacOS) or Alt+C (Windows)."
"What guidelines can developers follow to get better results from CodeWhisperer?","CodeWhisperer works most efficiently when developer comments are short and map to smaller discrete tasks so that no single function or code block is too long. Similarly, CodeWhisperer can generate helpful code suggestions when developers use intuitive names for various code elements, such as function names. The more code that is available as surrounding context, the better the suggestion will be."
"Can I turn off auto-suggestion?","Yes. You can pause auto-suggestions the CodeWhisperer section of the Developer Tools panel in the AWS Toolkit. Auto-suggestions will remain paused until you resume them. To manually trigger CodeWhisperer, use Option+C (MacOS) or Alt+C (Windows)."
"What is the CodeWhisperer reference tracker?","The CodeWhisperer reference tracker detects whether a code suggestion might be similar to particular CodeWhisperer open-source training data. The reference tracker can flag such suggestions with a repository URL and project license information or optionally filter them out. You can then more easily find and review the referenced code and see how it is used in the context of another project, before deciding to use it. All references are logged for you to review later to ensure that your code flow is not disturbed, and you can keep coding without interruption."
"What are the code-scanning capability of CodeWhisperer?","You can scan your Python, Java, and JavaScript code using the code-scanning capability for hard-to-find vulnerabilities such as those in the top 10 Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP), or those that don't meet crypto library best practices and other similar security best practices. Once it identifies security vulnerabilities, CodeWhisperer also provides suggestions on how to fix them."
"Where did AWS obtain the training data to build this service?","CodeWhisperer is a generative AI service powered by a foundation model trained on various data sources, including Amazon and open-source code."
"Who owns the code generated by CodeWhisperer?","Just like with your IDE, you own the code that you write, including any code suggestions provided by CodeWhisperer. You are responsible for the code that you write, including the CodeWhisperer suggestions that you accept. Always review the code suggestions before accepting them, and you may need to make edits to ensure that the code does exactly what you intended."
"Will CodeWhisperer produce code that looks similar to it training data?","As a generative AI, CodeWhisperer creates new code based on what it has learned from the code that it was trained on and the context that you provided as prior code and comments. While CodeWhisperer is not designed to reproduce code that it was trained on, it is possible that on rare occasions it will generate code that closely matches particular code snippets in the training data. If CodeWhisperer detects that its output matches particular open-source training data, the built-in reference tracker will notify you with a reference to the license type (for example, MIT or Apache) and a URL for the open-source project. You can then more easily find and review the referenced code and see how it is used in the context of another project before deciding whether to use it. To ensure that your coding flow is not disturbed, all references are logged for you to review later, so you can keep coding without interruption."
"Can I prevent CodeWhisperer from recommending code with code reference?","Yes. In the configuration setting for CodeWhisperer you can deselect the option “Include Suggestions With Code References.” This will prevent CodeWhisperer from making suggestions that include references to known licensed open-source code. For the free CodeWhisperer Individual Tier users, this setting is available in the IDE. With CodeWhisperer Professional, the AWS administrator can centrally configure this setting on an organization level from the AWS Management Console."
"Will CodeWhisperer produce toxic and biased code?","CodeWhisperer can filter out code suggestions that include toxic phrases and suggestions that contain commonly known code structures that indicate bias."
"Will CodeWhisperer recommend code with security vulnerability?","CodeWhisperer training data is analyzed for security vulnerabilities, and as many security vulnerabilities are filtered out as possible. The objective of this filtering is to reduce unsecure code patterns from the training data so that the model does not learn and generate them. However, given the generative nature of CodeWhisperer, we cannot completely rule out code suggestions with security issues. Therefore, CodeWhisperer comes with a built-in code scanning feature that detects security vulnerabilities within your Python, Java, and JavaScript projects, including code suggestions from CodeWhisperer and code written by you."
"Does CodeWhisperer only work in English Language?","CodeWhisperer was trained on various data sources, including Amazon and open-source code. CodeWhisperer has been trained and validated to generate code suggestions from English language comments. Given the variety of examples in the training dataset, it is possible that CodeWhisperer may provide code suggestions from comments written in non-English languages; however, this is not a supported use case."
"How much does CodeWhisperer cost?","CodeWhisperer Individual is free to use by creating and signing in with an AWS Builder ID. The sign-up process only takes a few minutes and does not require a credit card or an AWS account. CodeWhisperer Professional is $19 per user, per month and provides administrators the ability to enable CodeWhisperer for their organization with single sign-on (SSO) authentication. Administrators can more easily integrate CodeWhisperer with their existing workforce identity solutions, provide access to users and groups, and configure organization-wide settings, such as including or excluding suggestions with code references. See Amazon CodeWhisperer Pricing, https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/pricing/, for more details."
"In which AWS Regions is CodeWhisperer available?","CodeWhisperer is AWS Region agnostic and available to developers worldwide. CodeWhisperer is currently hosted in IAD (the US East (N. Virginia) Region). If you have IAM Identity Center in other regions (non-IAD), as a CodeWhisperer Professional administrator you can configure CodeWhisperer as an authorized cross-region application."
"How can I enable CodeWhisperer for my organization?","An AWS administrator can enable Amazon CodeWhisperer for an organization through the AWS Management Console. As a prerequisite, administrators must set up SSO through AWS IAM Identity Center (previously known as AWS Single Sign-On), if not already enabled for their organization. Once SSO authentication is set up, administrators can enable CodeWhisperer and assign access to users and groups in their organization."
"How do I set up SSO?","SSO for CodeWhisperer is enabled by IAM Identity Center. For more information, see here,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/codewhisperer-setup-enterprise-admin.html."
